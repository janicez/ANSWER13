			<!-- this value is used to calculate air-box resistance and BSFC.
			It also affects oil pressure among other things. -->

		<!-- AIR INTAKE -->
		
	<ram-air-factor> 0 </ram-air-factor>
			<!-- this number creates a pressure increase with an increase in dynamic pressure (aircraft speed). 
				is the efficiency of the air scoop intake. 0 turns ram air off. Default is 1. -->
	<air-intake-impedance-factor> 0 </air-intake-impedance-factor>
			<!-- this number is the pressure drop across the intake system. Increasing it reduces available manifold pressure.
				It is determined by <maxmp> if not supplied. -->

			<!-- this value is the nominal maximum manifold pressure at sea-level without boost.
			Along with maxrpm it determines the resistance of the aircraft's intake system.

			It is used for determining <BSFC> and <air-intake-impedance-factor> if a values are not supplied
			for those items. In a supercharged engine is always the pressure at sea level under standard 
			conditions (29.9). -->

	<minmp unit="INHG"> 8.8 </minmp>

			<!-- The altitude up to which rated boost can be maintained.
			Up to this altitude the boost is maintained constant for a given throttle position by the BCV or wastegate.
			Beyond this altitude the manifold pressure must drop, since the supercharger is now at maximum unregulated
			output. The actual pressure multiplier of the supercharger system is calculated at initialisation from this
			value. -->

		<!-- POWER PRODUCTION -->

    <volumetric-efficiency> 0.756 </volumetric-efficiency>
			<!-- controls how much air goes through the engine at a given RPM.
			Values below 1 for unboosted engines and values over 1 for boosted engines. -->
	<bsfc unit="LBS/HP*HR"> 0.429 </bsfc>
			<!-- Indicated Specific Fuel Consumption.
			The power produced per unit of fuel. Higher numbers give worse fuel economy.
			This number may need to be lowered slightly from actual BSFC numbers because some internal engine losses
			are modeled separately. --> 

		<!-- COOILING -->

    <cylinder-head-mass unit="LBS"> 120 </cylinder-head-mass>
			<!-- the nominal mass of a cylinder head. A larger value slows changes in engine temperature.
			So if you have a '5-minute' limit on a power setting you can adjust this
			value so the engine just starts to overheat at the end of the given time frame.-->
	<cooling-factor> 0.54 </cooling-factor>
			<!-- this number models how efficient the aircraft cooling system is. Raising the value makes
			the engine run cooler. This value is exposed on the property tree so it may be
			altered at runtime to simulate cowl flaps, for example. -->

		<!-- TUNEING -->
		
		<!--
    		* Using a constant speed load, set the engine model to full throttle and rated RPM.
    		* Set <ram-air-factor> to zero.
    		* Adjust <air-intake-impedance-factor> to achieve the proper static full throttle manifold pressure.
    		* Increase airspeed to cruise and adjust <ram-air-factor> to achieve the proper dynamic full throttle manifold pressure.
    		* Adjust <volumetric-efficiency> first to achieve desired fuel flow rate, leaning engine as required.
    		* Adjust <bsfc> to achieve desired power.
